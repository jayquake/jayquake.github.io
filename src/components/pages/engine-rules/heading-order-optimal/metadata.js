  title: `Heading levels should reflect the structure of the content`,
  description: `Incorrect heading hierarchy can create a misleading page outline, disrupt navigation by heading shortcuts, and cause confusion about the structure and importance of content. Using the correct heading level preserves a logical structure, allowing users to understand how sections relate to each other.`,
  advice: `Heading levels should reflect how each section relates to the main topic. Use <h1> for the overall subject,<h2> for major sections, and deeper levels, such as <h3> and <h4>, for subsections.`,
