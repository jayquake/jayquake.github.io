# Target Size (Minimum) - WCAG 2.5.8 - Level AA

Success Criterion 2.5.8, Target Size (Minimum), is about making sure that targets for interactive elements meet a minimum size or have enough spacing around them.

The simplest way to meet this criteria is to make sure the target size for interactive elements is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels.
If the target size is less than 24 by 24, then the interactive element must have enough space around it.

Exceptions:
1. When the interactive element is inline, such as a link within a sentence.
2. When there is another interactive element on the page that does the same thing and meets a minimum size or has enough space around it.
3. When the target size is default and you haven't changed it.
4. When the target size is essential (like maps).

2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced): At level AAA, the minimum target size is at least 44x44 CSS pixels.
