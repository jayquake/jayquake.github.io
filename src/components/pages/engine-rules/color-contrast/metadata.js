  title: "The color contrast ratio between text and its background should provide a readable experience",
  description: "The color contrast between foreground text and its background must be at lease at least 4.5:1 for normal text. Large-scale text, equal to or greater than 24px font size, or bold text that is equal to or greater than 18px, may meet a lower ratio of 3:1. However, it is recommended to meet the ratio 4.5:1 in all cases for readability.",
  advice: `Work with the website's designers to choose colors that properly meet the minimum contrast ratio requirements. To check color contrast with different potential colors, use Webaim's contrast checker at https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker`,
