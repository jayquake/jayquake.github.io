    <p>Semantic HTML helps improve accessibility and SEO by providing meaning to the content structure. It uses elements that describe their meaning and purpose to both the browser and the developer.</p>
    <p>Using elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> can make your content more understandable to both browsers and developers. These elements provide a clear indication of the different parts of a web page.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, semantic HTML elements convey the role and importance of the content, aiding search engines and assistive technologies in comprehending the page structure. This is crucial for users who rely on screen readers and other assistive technologies to navigate the web.</p>
    <p>Adopting semantic HTML also simplifies styling and scripting, as it provides a clear structure to target specific parts of the document. This can make your CSS more efficient and your JavaScript more effective.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, semantic HTML is a powerful tool for improving web accessibility, enhancing SEO, and making web development more efficient. By using semantic elements, you can create web pages that are more understandable, accessible, and effective.</p>
    <p>Moreover, semantic HTML is beneficial for the overall user experience. It helps in creating a more structured and easy-to-navigate website. It also plays a crucial role in improving the website's ranking in search engine results, thereby increasing the visibility of the website.</p>
