    'If you specifically coded headings without native HTML tags (like h1, h2, etc.) for SEO reasons or otherwise, use role="heading" and aria-level="1/2/3/4/5/6" (the appropriate heading level) to make sure that screen readers announce them as headings. For example, role="heading" aria-level="3" will be treated by screen readers as a h3 heading. Alternatively, you can directly code those elements as native HTML headings.',
