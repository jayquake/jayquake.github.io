  title: "Non-standard Captcha challenges must be replaced with an Accessible Provider (such as Google Recaptcha)",
  description: "Non-standard Captcha mechanisms are inaccessible by design. Captchas are explicitly meant to be challenging to answer in order to trick bots. Non-standard Captchas prevent screen reader users from submitting the website's forms.",
  advice: `Replace all non-standard Captcha fields with Google Recaptcha (or other Accessible Provider) which is fully accessible for screen readers and assistive technology by default. Learn more about Google Recaptcha here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/`,
