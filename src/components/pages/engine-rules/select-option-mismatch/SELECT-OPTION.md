# Select Option Role Option

This rule requires the right logic to parse the structure of the select options and check
if the all the selectable options have the **option** role.

The logic can either be implemented here directly in the recursive find function or it can
be implemented as the **PerceivableComponentSelectOption** in the classifier.
