  title: "Carousel pagination tabs should have accurate and descriptive labels",
  description: "If carousel pagination tabs are not given meaningful labels, screen reader users are unable to determine which slide or set of slides will be displayed when a tab is activated.",
  advice: `Provide each pagination tab with an accurate, descriptive label using aria-label or aria-labelledby. For single-slide navigation, use labels like “Slide 1,” “Slide 2,” etc. For grouped slides such as product cards, describe the range of items (e.g., “Products 1 to 4,” “Products 5 to 8”) and include category context when useful.`,
