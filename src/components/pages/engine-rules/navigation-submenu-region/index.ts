Assigning role="region" with a label makes each submenu a distinct, named section, clarifying its relationship to the trigger and improving orientation.',
  advice: 'Assign role="region" to each menu panel so screen reader users can distinguish submenus from surrounding page content. Adding a label (e.g., with aria-labelledby) helps users quickly identify each panel within a complex menu structure.',
